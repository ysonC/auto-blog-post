## Introduction

Phishing scams continue to pose a massive security threat. Automated spam filters and anti-phishing systems stop many suspicious emails and links. Yet, attackers still find ways to bypass these measures. When phishing attempts slip through, individual users become the last line of defence. Even tech-savvy people can find it difficult to judge a link’s legitimacy without specialised tools or expertise.

The researchers behind the paper “I Don’t Need an Expert! Making URL Phishing Features Human Comprehensible” explored why URLs can be so hard to interpret at a glance and how to make them clearer for everyday users. By combining expert-level verification techniques with a simple, user-friendly tool, they aim to help people spot malicious links before clicking.

## Why Are Links So Tricky?

A web address (URL) might look straightforward. Still, it includes multiple parts: protocol, subdomains, the primary domain name, top-level domain, and path or query strings. Phishers often use these components to deceive users. They register domains that closely resemble legitimate sites, sometimes by substituting letters or inserting brand names into the wrong part of the URL. Subdomain confusion occurs when an attacker places a known brand name at the front of the URL, making victims think they are visiting a trusted site when the actual domain belongs to someone else. Redirection and URL shorteners make it impossible to know the final destination without extra tools. Mixed character sets allow attackers to disguise harmful addresses with characters that look identical to actual letters, increasing the potential for trickery.

## The Research Approach

Security professionals often rely on extra tools, such as WHOIS lookups, to confirm the legitimacy of a suspicious link. However, these solutions can be scattered across different services, require technical background, and take time. The authors of this study wanted to centralize this information in a single “nutrition label” for URLs, allowing non-experts to leverage it quickly and make more informed decisions.

Their goals included making URL signals (like domain age, registration data, and popularity) accessible, helping people learn to detect phishing themselves, and preventing information overload by focusing only on the most relevant data. They used colour codes and concise summaries backed by plain-language explanations so users could see potential red flags at a glance while retaining enough detail to understand why something looked suspicious.

## Designing a “URL Feature Report”

The final design emerged through iterative sessions with cybersecurity experts, human-computer interaction specialists, and everyday users. This “URL feature report” starts with a clear message if a domain is already blacklisted as malicious or if it has a known verified owner. Key data points include the domain’s registration date, because a newly registered domain posing as a well-known site is suspicious, and whether the domain appears in top search results. Legitimate organizations are often easy to locate on Google, which is not true of many phishing sites.

Manipulation tricks appear in a dedicated section. The report flags these details if the URL uses visual similarities to a trusted brand name, excessive redirects, or unusual symbols. Colour coding makes severe issues stand out. Red means something is likely a problem, orange (or yellow) suggests caution, and green indicates no issue was found for that particular feature. Instead of a simple “safe or unsafe” verdict, the tool explains why something might be a concern, thus letting the user’s context guide the final decision.

## How Effective Is the Approach?

User studies showed that people with access to the full report became far more accurate in their judgments compared to those relying solely on a domain-highlighting feature. Even a shorter summary, containing the most crucial URL signals at a glance, helped many individuals reach the correct conclusions while avoiding dense technical jargon.

Participants felt more confident once they understood how each information fit into an overall safety assessment. They found the explanations highly useful, not just for the immediate decisions they faced but also for building a better mental model of how URL spoofing and phishing attacks work.

## Practical Implications

The findings suggest that a “URL feature report” could be integrated into actual email services or browsers, giving users an immediate, easy-to-read snapshot of a link’s trustworthiness. Instead of passively relying on spam filters, people could see why a site is suspect, learn to notice red flags on their own, and decide whether to proceed or avoid the link. Over time, these quick, context-rich cues might even serve as an ongoing educational tool, teaching users to spot phishing links more effectively. By combining the speed of automated filtering with concise, plain-language explanations, this approach could significantly reduce successful phishing attempts.

## Conclusion

Phishing persists because criminals adapt their tactics faster than any filter or training method can manage. The research on making URL phishing features “human comprehensible” shows a promising way to close that gap by giving ordinary users more profound insight into where a link leads. Presenting domain age, popularity rankings, search visibility, and specific warning signs in a clear, user-friendly layout can help non-experts detect even sophisticated fakes. In the long run, tools like these could make everyone safer online, turning potential phishing targets into informed guardians of their own security.
