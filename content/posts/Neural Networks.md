A **neural network** is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It learns patterns from data by processing information through interconnected layers of nodes (neurons).

### Structure of a Neural Network:

1. **Input Layer**:
    - Takes in the data features (e.g., height, weight, color).
2. **Hidden Layers**:
    - Contains multiple neurons that process the data using mathematical operations (e.g., weighted sums, activations).
    - These layers find complex patterns in the data.
3. **Output Layer**:
    - Produces the final result (e.g., classification or prediction).

---
### How It Works:

1. **Input**: Data flows into the network through the input layer.
2. **Weights**: Each connection has a "weight" that controls how much influence one neuron has on another.
3. **Activation Function**: Non-linear functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid) decide if a neuron "activates" or passes information forward.
4. **Output**: After passing through layers, the output is compared to the actual result to calculate error.
5. **Learning**:
    - The network adjusts its weights using an algorithm like **backpropagation** and **gradient descent** to reduce the error.

---
### Key Concepts:

- **Training**: Process of finding the best weights using data.
- **Epochs**: One full pass of the dataset through the network.
- **Loss Function**: Measures the error (difference between predicted and actual values).

---
### Pros:

- Can handle complex, non-linear relationships.
- Performs well on images, text, audio, etc.
### Cons:

- Needs a lot of data and computational power.
- Hard to interpret (like a "black box").

### Example:

- **Image Classification**: A neural network can learn to recognize cats in photos by analyzing patterns like edges, shapes, and textures in the image.
